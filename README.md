# Covid-daily
can just run the jupyter notebook once and recieve a summary of covid-19 scraped from google.org  
the final output consists of: 
  
  -  a csv file containing the details of all the countries with COVID-19 cases 
  - an image of bar graph for top 10 countries based on the number of COVID-19 cases.
